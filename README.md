## Configuration of PDO

To configure your PDO to communicate with your database. Put your config in `config/database_example_conf.php` and, once done, rename the file `database.conf.php`.
Our project works on Nginx and Apache.

### Logs

We have a log system. So, if you have an error, go to `logs/` to find it.
